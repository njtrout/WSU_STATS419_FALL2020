This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r, mychunck-local, message=FALSE}
library(devtools) 
my.source = 'local';
local.path = "C:/Users/Nic Trout/Documents/C/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020/WEEK-03/";
source(paste0(local.path, "functions/libraries.R"), local=T );
source(paste0(local.path, "functions/functions-imdb.R"), local=T );


#source("WEEK-03/functions/libraries.R", local=F)
#source("WEEK-03/functions/functions-imdb.R")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
