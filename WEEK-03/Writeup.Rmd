```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r, mychunk-global, message = false, echo = false}

library(devtools) #devtools is required for function source_url to work
my.source = 'github';
github.path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njtrout/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020/";
source_url(paste0(github.path, "master/WEEK-03/functions/libraries.R"));
source_url(paste0(github.path, "master/WEEK-03/functions/functions-imdb.R"));


```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
source("WEEK-03/functions/libraries.R");
source("WEEK-03/functions/functions-imdb.R");
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
source
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
