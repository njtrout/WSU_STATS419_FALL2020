## TESTING PROCEDURE
 
This midterm exam (Rnotebook-midterm) is worth 150 points.  For each question, review how much the item is worth in terms of points and plan your time wisely. 

I would deem it "unwise" to spend hours on a question that is only worth 5 points.

### Static/Existing Resources Are Allowed
 
This is an open-book examination.  You can use your course notebooks (digital and old-school).  You can use Internet resources (stackoverflow, Wikipedia, and Youtube).  

### Dynamic/Living Resources Are _ **NOT**_  Allowed

**You cannot use a living resource on the exam.**  That would include a classmate, student, sibling, parent, a tutor, online forums (where you ask the question after the exam period has begun). 

If you have questions that need clarifying, please **email the instructor** and he will try to answer them by email or ZOOM.  He will be checking his email often during the week of the exam, to make himself available to you.

### Levels of Mastery

* Do You **Remember**?
* Do You **Understand**?
* Can You **Apply** what you remember/understand to another similar problem?
* Can You **Analyze** and **Synthesize** Data?
* Can You **Evaluate** your analyses?
* Can You **Create** meaningful visualizations and summaries?  

### Rubric of Mastery 
 
For every 10 points, this is the general breakdown.
 
| Emerging       | Developing     | Mastering    |
| :------------- | :----------:   | -----------: |

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing data to summarize its main characteristics.

Confirmatory data analysis (CDA) is the process of applying specific statistical methods to analyze the data.  The goal is also to summarize its main characteristics.  We commonly refer to CDA as "statistical hypothesis testing".  CDA generally makes assumptions about how the data is distributed.  Or wants to apply a specific model to the data.

So the two approaches have the same objective:  summarize the main characteristics of the data.  How they achieve that objective is very different.  

## Introduction 

### John Tukey
John Tukey is the father of "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey>.  My favorite statistics book is his 1977 book (not surprising) entitled "Exploratory Data Analysis."

### Exploratory vs Confirmatory
From Wikipedia (Accessed October 2020):  Tukey "also contributed to statistical practice and articulated the important distinction between exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis, **believing that much statistical methodology placed too great an emphasis on the latter**."

I belong to the "Tukey" camp. I believe too much emphasis is place on "formal statistical methods and tests".  I believe more emphasis should be placed on the underlying nature of the data.  These underlying principles are how the statistical methods developed.  

As a data analyst, I believe that first and foremost, we should let the data speak.  That is why the first half of the semester started in this form.  The second half (confirmatory data analysis) will rely on what is labeled by many as "formal statistical methods".

### Tukey and "Bell Labs"

In 1965, Tukey divided his time between working at Princeton University and working at Bell Labs (a research think tank).  

#### Robust Statistics as Nonparametric

Tukey proposed that five summary data are essential to understanding numerical data:  `min`, `max`, `median` (technically `Q2`), and `Q1` and `Q3` (the quartiles).  In `R`, the function `summary` has only added `mean` to Tukey's proposal from years ago.

#### Box and Whisker Plot 

In 1975, Tukey invented the "box and whisker" plot that identifies the median, inter-quartile range (IQR), and outliers of data.  The visualization displays the data without making any assumptions about its statistical distribution.  The boxplot is a working demonstration of EDA.  **Let the data speak!**

### John Chambers and `S` and `R`
At the same time ast John Tukey, three other men were also working at Bell Labs (John Chambers, Rick Becker, and Allan Wilks) on a statistical programming language `S` that emphasized EDA.  This "statistical computing" language was programming mostly in `Fortran` with some `C` programming.    Chambers published his first "statistical computing" text in 1977, titled "Computational methods for data analysis" <https://archive.org/details/computationalmet0000cham/page/n11/mode/2up>

Between 1988 and 1991, Chambers updated the engine of `S` to make it more robust.  That same engine still powers much of `R` today.  That is, much of the base code of `S` was written by Chambers himself. `R` today still uses much of that `S` codebase under the hood.  

`R` was an open-source offshoot (a "fork") of `S` which occurred in the mid 1990s.  Today, Chambers is still active in the `S`-now`R` community.  My favorite book of his is titled (2008): "Software for data analysis programming with R".  My second-favorite book of his is titled (1998): "Programming with data: a guide to the S language".  In 2016, he authored another book that I still need to read "Extending R."  

Modern `R` is written in `Fortran`, `C`, and `C++`.  

Since its foundation is primarily `C`, we can use standard "make" and "make-install" tools to compile R or its packages from the source code.  That is why we needed `Rtools` on Windows.  The MacOS is now linux based, so no additional tools are required.

## Summary

EDA as exploration is an iterative process.  

### Analogy: learning a foreign language
I like to use the analogy of learning a foreign language using the "immersion" approach. For example, I studied Spanish in high school, learned vocabulary and grammar, and really could not speak the language well.  

I did learn to speak the language well by being dropped into a foreign country for nearly two years.  Some key ingredients to learn a language in an "immersive" environment are listed below:  

- surround yourself with others speaking the language to be learned [e.g., I did not spend a lot of time with other Americans speaking English]. 
- be present when engaged in the language.  Listen intently and try to understand as much as you can, not worrying about what you don't fully understand.  

- reflect after language engagement.  Try to synthesize what "gaps" you have and then develop study habits to fill in those gaps.

- practice what you have learned.

To some degree, my success was likely accelerated because I had precursory training.  Regardless, "immersive" practices benefit learning new languages.

### Proficiency in Data Analytics

[As part of your journey, I have asked you to keep a "paper-and-pencil" notebook to write down words/phrases/ideas.  For example, in this section, there may be words/terms/phrases/ideas you don't fully understand.]

Proficiency requires an iteration of these key features described above.  But first, you have to understand what language you are trying to speak.  Is it `R`?  Is it Statistics?  Mathematics?  What exactly is the language?

In my opinion, the language is the "language of data". 

### The "language of data"

How do you think mathematics developed?  It likely started with simple data, based on real-world experience:  two hands, five fingers on each hand gives me the number ten.  Counting in a base-10 system likely resulted.  An entire domain of mathematics called "number theory" devotes its studies to these integer values.

How do you think statistics developed?  People went out and started measuring things.  One person would literally walk down the street in the late 1800s and ask if he could measure a person's proportions.  Another person would study crop yields at different locations and tried to ascertain if they were different. 

The foundation of mathematics and statistics is data. So I believe, we should let the data speak.

### Let the data speak

So I am definitely an EDA-guy.  Some people are, some people are not.  I personally am a strong believer that we should **let the data speak**, learn how to describe the data without imposing any restrictions on it, and always think about the data first and foremost.  

I also believe that we should use logic, intuition, and insight before we develop any formal "confirmatory" hypothesis testing.  I have intentionally architected this course to emphasis EDA.

### Quality data provenance

I am also very ademant about **data provenance** as I believe the "outputs" of any analysis (whether exploratory or confirmatory) is as only as good as the data quality.  I call this `data intimacy`.  You should care just as much about the process to get quality data as you do to analyze said data.

The term **GIGO** (garbage-in, garbage-out) in my estimation represents what happens when care for quality data is treated lightly.  

### Iterative Exploration
This full EDA approach is a multi-lens approach.  View the data from as many different perspectives as possible before arriving at a conclusion.  Base your conclusion on a synthesis of what you analyzed from those different perspectives.

- We do initial EDA (using mathematical foundations), 
- then we may do confirmatory analyses (traditional statistical methods), and 
- then we synthesize our findings and do a higher-ordered EDA using the original analysis and the confirmatory analysis to make final decisions using sound logic and intuition.
- this process will enlighten our understand and possibly help us formulate new suppositions and think about what additional data would inform the topic.

## (10 points) YOUR "EDA" OPINION 
[
I have expressed my opinion about the study of data and the importance of EDA in that study.  What is your opinion on this topic?

This is worth 10 points, a minimal answer should be at least 3 paragraphs. Agreeing/Disagreeing with my opinion is not how you will be evaluated.  How well you express YOUR opinion is what is important.]

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

Overall, I agree with you as proficiency in data analytics is the "language of data" because if you can understand the data it is much easier to manipulate/observe. Yeah you must understand some R, Statistics, and Math but if you cant understand the language of the data, you cannot do any of that in the fist place.

As you stated "I believe more emphasis should be placed on the underlying nature of the data." I think it is important to put more emphasis on the nature of the data because if the data is not clean it becomes very difficult to observe your observations.

CDA is an analysis of data to test the validity of an already existing theory or hypothesis. EDA is an analysis that generates new knowledge by analyzing data attempting to find trends in observations. I like the idea of having clean data to perform EDA to "let the data speak" as you stated. When it comes CDA and EDA, I think it is more effective to look at EDA trends rather than the CDA approach.

## SIMULATING DATA 

### (10 points) Basic Simulation 

- Pick a `set.seed` choice so the code is replicable.  Verify that every time you run the commands, the data is not changing with the seed "you chose".
- Use the functions `rnorm`, `runif` to simulate data.  
- Simulate `n=9999;` data for each.  
- Call `x.rnorm` the data for the first and `x.runif` the data for the second.  
- Plot a histogram `graphics::hist` and report the summary statistics ``base::summary` of each. 
- Then, plot them using `plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);`.  
- Finally, `plot(x.rnorm, sample(x.rnorm) );` and compare it to `plot(x.runif, sample(x.runif) );`.  


#### Code of simulation
```{r, chunk-simulating-rnorm-runif, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

set.seed(1234);

x.rnorm = rnorm(n = 9999, 1, 0.5);
x.runif = runif(n = 9999, 0,1);
graphics::hist(x.rnorm);
graphics::hist(x.runif);
base::summary(x.rnorm);
base::summary(x.runif);
plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);
plot(x.rnorm, sample(x.rnorm));
plot(x.runif, sample(x.runif));

```

#### **Describe `rnorm`, `runif`**

- Describe what each function `rnorm` and `runif` does. How are they similar?  How are they different? 

- What does the `sample` function do?

- How was `plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);` different from `plot(x.rnorm, ( x.rnorm.sample = sample(x.rnorm) ) );` and `plot(x.runif, ( x.runif.sample = sample(x.runif) ) );`? 
How would you describe the shape of each of these plots?

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

Rnorm and runif are similar in the way that they both generate numerica data. Rnorm and runif are different because rnorm generates a vector of normally distributed random numbers. Where runif generates random numbers between 0 and 1.

sample is used to get a sample of numeric/character vector and dataframes.

`plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);` This plots shows most of the numbers generated fall be 0 and 2 with there being some outliers between 0 and -1 and also between 2 and 3.

`plot(x.rnorm, ( x.rnorm.sample = sample(x.rnorm) ) );`This plot shows as you approach 1 the sample(x.norm) increases

`plot(x.runif, ( x.runif.sample = sample(x.runif) ) );`This plot shows all values fall between 0 and 1.

</pre>

### (5 points) "Easter-Egg" Simulation 

- There was an "Easter Egg" that related to setting the seed `set.seed` using `rbinom`.  If you search in the BlackBoard discussion forum for `easter` you will see the discussion about August 25-27.
- In the "Easter Egg", the goal was to find a scenario using a specific `set.seed` that would simulate flipping a coin 100 times and getting one result (heads/tails) exactly 52 times. 
- In this problem, the search criteria has changed.  Simulate flipping a coin 1000 times and getting one result (heads/tails) exactly 555 times. 
- You need to report 5 values for `set.seed` that achieves this objective.  You can report more.  
- You should explicitly have the code print `length(x)` where `x` is a vector of the values that meet the objective.


```{r, chunk-simulating-rbinom, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

nsim = 500000;
y= 1:nsim;
ns = 0;
which = numeric(0);
for(i in y)
  {
  set.seed(i);
  res = rbinom(n = 1, 1000, 0.5);
  if(res == 555)
    {
    cat(i, sep = "\n");
    ns = 1 + ns;
    which = c(which, i);
    }
  }
x = which;
length(x);

```

### Rolling the Dice

- You have 3 dice.
- Each dice has the numbers `1:10` ... they are ten-sided die ("decader" die).
- Write the necessary `for-loops` to capture all possible outcomes of rolling the three dice at the same time.
- A dataframe `myrolls` should have three columns: `dice.1`, `dice.2`, `dice.3` plus a fourth column `roll.total` which is the sum `dice.1 + dice.2 + dice.3` of one iteration of the nested `for loop`.
- Report the dimensions `dim` of `myrolls`.
- Create a table `outcomes.table` that summarizes the counts of the `myrolls$roll.total` 
- Transform the table to a dataframe `outcomes.df`. Name the columns: c("roll.total", "count");
- Report the sum of `outcome.df$count`
- Create a new column `outcomes.df$prob` (Probability) that determines the probability of that row given the total sum of the `count` column.
- Display the dataframe.

#### Setting Up the Dice Scenario 
```{r, chunk-simulating-dice, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## your code goes here ...

dice.1 = dice.2 = dice.3 = 1:10;

myrolls = NULL;
for(d1 in dice.1)
  {
  for(d2 in dice.2)
    {
    for(d3 in dice.3)
      {
      roll.total = d1 + d2 + d3;
      row = c(d1, d2, d3, roll.total);
      myrolls = rbind(myrolls, row);
      }
    }
  }

myrolls = as.data.frame(myrolls);
colnames(myrolls) = c("dice.1", "dice.2", "dice.3", "roll.total");

myrolls;
print("Dimensions of myrolls");
dim(myrolls);

outcomes.table = table(myrolls$roll.total);
outcomes.df = as.data.frame(outcomes.table);
  colnames(outcomes.df) = c("roll.total", "count");


total.sum = sum(outcomes.df$count);
print("Sum of outcomes.df$count");
total.sum;

outcomes.df$prob = outcomes.df$count / total.sum;
outcomes.df;

```
#### Viewing a subset of data to answer a question  

- How many ways can I roll a 23 when I throw the dice at the same time?  What is the probability that I roll a 23 on a single throw?

```{r, chunk-simulating-dice-subset-a, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
# if you don't have the latest version of humanVerseWSU, you can access the function as follows:
# library(devtools);
# source_url(paste0( path.github, "humanVerseWSU/R/functions-dataframe.R" ));

sub.myrolls = subsetDataFrame(myrolls, "roll.total", "==", 23);

sub.myrolls;

sub.outcomes.df = subsetDataFrame(outcomes.df, "roll.total", "==", 23);

sub.outcomes.df;


```
 

#### (10 points) Questions from the Dice simulation 

##### **Roll 23**
- How many ways can I roll a 23 when I throw the dice at the same time?  What is the probability that I roll a 23 on a single throw?

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

You can roll a 23 36 different ways and the probability that you roll a 23 on a single throw is 0.036.

</pre>

##### **Roll 12 or 22** 
- What is the probability that I roll a 12 or a 22 on a single throw?

```{r, chunk-simulating-dice-subset-b, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
## your code goes here ... if necessary

sub.outcomes.df = subsetDataFrame(outcomes.df, "roll.total", "==", 12);

sub.outcomes.df;

sub.outcomes.df = subsetDataFrame(outcomes.df, "roll.total", "==", 22);

sub.outcomes.df;

```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

You can roll 12 55 different ways with a .055 probability. You can roll 22 45 different ways with a .045 probability. So there is a .100 probability you will roll a 12 or 22. 

</pre>


##### **Roll 26 or 29** 
- What is the probability that I roll a 26 or a 29 on a single throw?

```{r, chunk-simulating-dice-subset-c, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## your code goes here ... if necessary
sub.outcomes.df = subsetDataFrame(outcomes.df, "roll.total", "==", 26);

sub.outcomes.df;

sub.outcomes.df = subsetDataFrame(outcomes.df, "roll.total", "==", 29);

sub.outcomes.df;


```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

You can roll 26 15 different ways with a .015 probability. You can roll 29 3 different ways with a .003 probability. So there is a .018 probability you will roll a 26 or 29. 

</pre>

##### **Roll 3 once/twice in a row** 
- What is the probability that I roll a 3 on a single throw?  What is the probability that I roll a 3 twice in a row?  First throw = 3 **AND** second throw = 3?

```{r, chunk-simulating-dice-subset-d, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## your code goes here ... if necessary
sub.myrolls = subsetDataFrame(myrolls, "roll.total", "==", 3);

sub.myrolls;

sub.outcomes.df = subsetDataFrame(outcomes.df, "roll.total", "==", 3);

sub.outcomes.df;

```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

The probability that I roll a 3 is .001 and the probability that I would roll a 3 a second time in a row would be .000001.

</pre>

##### **Roll 12 or lower** 

- What is the probability that I roll at most a 12 on a single throw?  That is, a 12 or lower ...

```{r, chunk-simulating-dice-subset-e, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## your code goes here ... if necessary

```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

The probability of rolling 12 or lower is summing the probability of 3-12 which is .22.

## INITIAL EXPLORATION OF REAL DATA

We are going to use exploratory techniques to examine some Indeed.com data.  If you recall, this `job` data examines how many jobs reference a certain keyword.  Every Monday morning at 12:00:00AM EST (using a scheduler `crontab`), this data collection is performed.  A few weeks ago, I added some new keys words.  The data set we have consists of 5 weeks:  `2020-38` to `2020-42`.

- For each "search phrase", I go to Indeed.com and download the first page of results.  
- From this first page, I grab the "total count"
- An example is shown in a screenshot, taken this week.

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

### Import "jobs" data
- Run code to import the data `jobs`.

```{r, chunk-plotting-load-jobs, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
jobs = utils::read.csv( paste0(path.mshaffer, "_data_/indeed-jobs.txt"), header=TRUE, quote="", sep="|");

colnames(jobs) = c("year.week", "search.query", "job.count");
jobs;

```

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

- Create a `hist` and `boxplot` and report `summary(jobs$job.count)`.

### (5 points) Histogram and Box Plot 
```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-boxplot, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

hist(jobs$job.count);

boxplot(jobs$job.count~jobs$year.week, data = jobs);

summary(jobs$job.count)

```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

The histogram tells you that frequency of jobs being searched and it shows that most jobs searched are searched under 50,000 times with the exception of some jobs being search more. For example, excel is searched 375,999 times which is why on the histogram there is a small rectangle representing that search between 300,000 and 400,000.


The boxplot shows there is a slight increase in job searches throughout the 5 weeks. 

The summary tells you the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, max of jobs being searched. The mean amount of jobs searched are 15,170 in 5 weeks, a min of 0 and a max of 404,527. 


</pre>
[What does the histogram tell you about the data?  What does the boxplot tell you about the data?  What does `summary` tell you about the data?]

Answered this above.

This boxplot is of job.count on the x and frequency on the y. This shows you how many times the jobs are searched. In this case the jobs.subset histogram shows the number of these jobs related to our degree that are searched, it shows some searched 50,000-100,000 times but majority of the jobs listed are searched 0-50,000 times in the 5 week period we are looking at.

#### Initial Perspective

The first plot show the job count in 1000's over a 4 week period (week 38-40) and all searches look linear with some having a slight increase in searches throughout the 4 week period. 

The second plot show the job count in 1000's over a 4 week period and most searches look to be linear or slightly increasing. But there is one outlier being searched, that is Git. You can see it starts out being searched just under 20k times and then in the second week (week 40) there is a dip down to 0 job searches, then spikes back up to almost 20k in week 3. This to me seems to be missing data.

#### Is "Microsoft Office" bigger than "C++"?

I use the term "bigger" or "better" intentionally.  We are comparing two items, and these are generic ways of communicating such a comparison.  In context of this data problem, a formalized form of the question would be something like:  "Utilizing job count for a given search query, determine if the query 'Microsoft Office' has a larger job count than the query 'C++'?"  This question will need to be formalized if we are trying to draw specific conclusions, but the initiation of analysis "which is bigger" allows us to understand what the data says or does not say, through exploration.  

To answer the question:

Mathematically, if two lines are parallel, and one is above the other, can we use **distance** to draw a conclusion?  Now, many times in statistics we deal with noise in the data, it is not "deterministic" but "stochastic" ... so we need to understand the variability.  Based on the data we see, can we not use  "parallel-line" logic to conclude that they are different?  This is one dimension of EDA, use mathematics. ("mathematics")

```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-trends-microsoft, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

do.nothing = plotJobs(jobs.subset, myy.lim = c(80,250) );

boxplotJobQueryComparison(jobs.subset, "Microsoft Office", "C++");

```
Tukey invented the boxplot as a nice EDA representation of the data.  What logical inference can we make about the distances between the boxplots and the fact that no data is overlapping.  This is another dimension of EDA, use "distance" and the boxplot "IQR" to compare two elements.  What conclusion would we make? ("boxplot")

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

Yes we can conclude that the data is difference because the two box plots show completely different data results. The C++ boxplot is comparing the number of searches being done for C++ and Microsoft Office. The C++ boxplot appears to have a an average search of a little over 160k searches with a min of 159k and a max of about 175k. The Microsoft boxplot shows a min number of searches of about 225k, the mean is at the top of the IQR now at about 232k. Microsoft appears to have no max as there is an extreme outliar just shy of 240k. 

No I dont think that inferential statistical test would tell us anything different.

I think formal tests were derived from mathmatics as mathematics is part of analysis but also from EDA.

</pre>

[Can we conclude the data are different based on "mathematics" or "boxplot"?

I conclude that the data is different based on the boxplots.

Would a formal "inferential statistical test" tell us something different than logical inference?  

I don't think with this data that inferential statistical tests would tell us anything different than logical inference.

How do you think "formal tests" were derived if not from "mathematics" and "boxplot" (EDA)?]




```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-trends-microsoft-answer, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

# courage in trusting your intuition may require a fall-back ... for those that need it ...

t.test.jobs(jobs.subset, "Microsoft Office", "C++");

#### Is "Statistics" bigger than "Java"?

```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-trends-statistics, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

do.nothing = plotJobs(jobs.subset, myy.lim = c(49,53) );

do.nothing = boxplotJobQueryComparison(jobs.subset, "Statistics", "Java");

t.test.jobs(jobs.subset,"Statistics", "Java");

```

For this data, I can descriptively report that the third-quartile `Q3` of "Statistics" is about equal to the `median` of "Java".  The inter-quartile range (`IQR`) of each overlap.  The minimum value of "Java" is larger than the minimum value of "Statistics".  The maximum value of "Java" is slightly smaller than the maximum value of "Statistics".

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

When looking at the box plot it appears that on average Java is searched more but that may not be accurate. Especially since when doing a T test there is a p value greater .05, .63>.05 so you fail to reject the null hypo "stat is not bigger than Java" so with that you cannot say that stat is bigger than Java.

</pre>

boxplotJobQueryComparison(jobs.subset, "Data science", "Big data");

```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

Based on the plot it appears data science will have a higher search but when looking at the P value you get .3 and .3>.05 so you fail to reject the null hypo "data science is not bigger than big data" therefore, you cannot conclude clearly what is actually searched more. 

I think that it is somewhat likely that there is a job posting with both key words in it. Our initiation and logic lets us determine if we need to make in depth and question observations decisions. Moving forward an improved approach would be to have a unique identifier for each job listing to understand what jobs have multiple key searches in the title. 

</pre>

[Use "mathematics" and "boxplot" and "ttest" to make a conclusion.  

Next, think carefully about the nature of the data.  Is the "collection-approach" flawed to make a conclusion comparing job-counts of these specific keywords? How likely is it that a single-job posting may have both keywords?

This is an example where "data-integrity" knowledge would surpass the other three logical conclusions.

This intuition requires an understanding of what mathematicians call "set theory".  If I am doing an independent search on keywords, is it possible that one job would show up in multiple searches.  That is, being counted twice or more. 

Intuition and logic would also allow us to conclude that our other comparisons are "very likely okay".  Why?

What would be an improved approach to collecting the data that would allow me to more accurately compare these two keywords?

This is representative of why exploratory data analysis is essential.  It provides us insight into the domain and highlights the need for better data, if we can find it.

### Conclusions on logical inference

Distance is a fundamental unit of comparison.  We can use our "mathematical" understanding of distance.  We can use an "EDA" understanding of the data (e.g., the boxplot).  We need to understand the data sourcing and how that will relate to the logical conclusions we are trying to draw. 

When we transition to "confirmatory inferential statistics", we cannot leave our understanding of "maths" and "EDA" behind.  They are the foundation from which "inferential statistics" is built.  They are "logical inference".

## COMPUTING DISTANCES

If you recall, we had a notebook on collecting data from Wikipedia.  We documented the "data-provenance" protocols to make this happen.  We have documented and can replicate our data-collection strategies.

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

### (10 points) Data Provenance defined

Imagine you are preparing for a job interview.  Write a 90-second blurb describing "what is data provenance" and "why it matters".  I would suggest the STAR(S) approach mentioned in one of the notebooks.  Reference the "Wikipedia" project as an example of how one can implement the features.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

Data Provenance is what helps us understand the quality of the data. You want to make sure who has access to your data and what is being done to the data, therefore you need to keep track of it. That is where Data Provenance comes in. It includes things like data origin, understanding how the data is transformed, and where the data moves over time. It is used for things like to validate data, debugging, finding lost data, dependencies, and much more. Basically Data Provenance is keeping track of everything you do to your data and that is a must in order to make your code/data manipulations repeatable.

Data Provenance is crucial because in today's world because we have so much data, but the data is hardly ever clean. Most data in the real world is unstructured data. Therefore, there is a lot of manipulations of the data, room for loss data, bugs, and much more. So when using Data Provenance you can catch these issue before they are a real problem. Which is why data provenance is so important. It will save time and catch issue before they are a problem.

This box is not a square because in your buildBoundingBoxFromRadiusAndGivenLatitudeLongitude function you specify your latitude and longitude to make it a rectangle. Latitude and longitude are not the same therefore cannot make a sqaure.

#### (5 points) Comparing "Visualization Options"

Above, the data was displayed using three different visualization packages.

The first `plot_usmap` uses the ``ggplot2` methodology which is tied to the "tidyverse" landscape of the `R` community.

The second `voronoi.mosaic` uses the graph-theory topology known as Voroni partitioning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram> with the "base" plot function to visualize the topology.

The last one `map` is from the "base" environment.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

Visually I would say the first plot (ggplot2) is the most appealing to me as it seems the most friendly to read and to relay information.

Functionally, I think the third plot (base) is the most functional as it looks to pin point the actual location. The first plot is hard to tell exactly where the capitals are.

One key factor that would determine the appropriateness would be if we were looking for similar trends between those states.

Visually, which is the most appealing to you?  Why?

Let's start with geo-spatial distances.  I will do `distMeeus` and you will do `distHaversine`

##### **Meeus**
These distance formulas can utilize the true geo-spatial coordinates.  The distance table is getting large, so there is a helper function to lookup a certain value.

```{r, chunk-distances-meeus, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(geosphere);
library(measurements);


dist.meeus = conv_unit(  distm( latlong[,3:4],
                  fun=distMeeus),  "m", "mi");  # default meters to miles

dist.meeus.m = as.matrix( dist.meeus );
  rownames(dist.meeus.m) = 
  colnames(dist.meeus.m) = myLabels;

dist.meeus.df = as.data.frame( round( dist.meeus.m, digits=1) );

dist.meeus.df;  ## too big

lookupPairwiseValue(dist.meeus.df, "Juneau, AK", "Montgomery, AL");

```

##### **Haversine**
```{r, chunk-distances-haversine, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

                  fun=distHaversine),  "m", "mi");  # default meters to miles

dist.haversine.h = as.matrix( dist.haversine );
  rownames(dist.haversine.h) = 
  colnames(dist.haversine.h) = myLabels;

dist.haversine.df = as.data.frame( round( dist.haversine.h, digits=1) );

dist.haversine.df; 

lookupPairwiseValue(dist.haversine.df, "Juneau, AK", "Montgomery, AL");

```


You can compare the two with the code below (currently in comments).

There is not a big difference in the two calculations above, you can see the distances measured are close to the same.

Meeus is measuring the shortest distance on an ellipsoid, where are Haversine is measuring the shortest distance between two points via the great circle distance meaning this method assumes spherical earth, ignoring the ellipsoidal effects.

Yes they are very similar. According the meeus the .distGeo is more accurate.

Let's now do `manhattan` and `euclidean` which are more common in the "statistical clustering" domain.  I will do `euclidean`.

Manhattan has longer distances than euclidean. No they are not similar because there are some distances up to 1000 miles highers on the manhattan method.

## HIERARCHICAL clustering as a function of distance

Aggregating or agglomerating data is typically called "clustering" and is generally considered to be a "unsupervised learning" method.


### Introduction
We use `hclust` to perform Hierarchical Clustering.  The word "hierarchical" is used because the nature of the data is organized like a family genealogy.  The bottom of the tree represents the descendants that eventually "link" to a common ancestor.

If you type `?hclust` you can review the parameter options which we explored in a notebook.  `hclust` is primarily a function of `dist()` [distance], and we have just computed some distances, so we could try and apply `hclust` to our data to see if our state capitals will cluster into meaningful regions.

There are several agglomeration methods ("linkage") one could choose from.  Each method takes the `dist` <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Metric> and performs some pairwise distance algorithm called a linkage criteria <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Linkage_criteria>.

I generally use either the "complete" linkage method or the "ward.D2" linkage method.  You can read help `?hclust` to better appreciate why: "A number of different clustering methods are provided. Ward's minimum variance method aims at finding compact, spherical clusters. The complete linkage method finds similar clusters."

If you are trying to link binary data (zeroes and ones) or genomic data (where the distances were computed using a genetic-distance algorithm), you may want to try the UPGMA approach: "average" or "centroid".  

### Analogy of Family

Since I am from a large family, I will make a family tree analogy.  For me, I am the 5th of 11 siblings (5 brothers, 5 sisters).  If I wanted to cluster the siblings in a pair-wise fashion, how would I begin?

First, I would ask, which other sibling is most like me?  Since this is a pair-wise approach, and there are 11 siblings, maybe at the initial stage, I will not be paired with another sibling.

In fact, at least one will not be paired because the total number is 11.  And maybe more than one will not be paired in the initial stage.  Remember "similarity" is being defined based on some distance-linkage method.  And to use this approach, "similarity" needs to numerical data.

At each stage, pair-wise joining occurs until there is nothing left to join.  The tree contains all of the elements.  Every element (branch) eventually joins the main branch (trunk) of the tree.  

### Clustering U.S. capital cities based on latitude, longitude

We already have some data for the U.S. capitals and have computed a Euclidean distance using a capital-city's longitude and latitude.  Let's choose to cut the result into `12` agglomerations.  Why 12?  It was a choice based on my life experience and intuition.  As I reflected on why, I did some external searching that validates a choice in that range <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States>.  You certainly could run this analysis with another choice  It is exploratory, and your intuition matters.

Geographically, I am saying the capital-city does represent the state.  An ideal representation may be in the center (centroid) of the state.  Remember this when we see the linkages with "New York", the city is Albany, not Manhattan.

```{r, chunk-distances-hclust-euclidean, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## ward.D2
hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean = hclust(dist.euclidean, method="ward.D2");

plot( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, 
      labels= myLabels );
rect.hclust( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12 );

## complete
#
#hclust.complete.dist.euclidean = hclust(dist.euclidean, method="complete");
# 
#plot( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, 
#     labels= myLabels );
#rect.hclust( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12 );
   

```

### Understanding the `cutree`

In the above example, the tree was cut into 12 groups based on the "distance" formula used and based on the "agglomeration" linkage technique invoice.  I likely should have used a "geo-spatial" distance, but we will see that mere "euclidean" distance seems to perform okay.  

A fancy word for this statistical tree is a "dendrogram".  I call each element of the tree a branch.  The smallest branches (twigs) are the fundamental elements, in this case the cities.  Over time, they merge with other small branches, and so on.

The relative height when this smallest branch merges with another branch demonstrates when the branch has found a similar pair-wise match (with another smallest branch or a merging branch).  I call "Honolulu Hawaii" an isolate because the vertical height when it merges with another branch is the highest of all of the smallest branches (e.g., cities).  "Juneau Alaska" is another isolate, but it does merge before "Hawaii".

It would be nice if we could decompose this information and look at one `cutree` at a time.  And color-code the distinctions.  Using the function `plot.hclust.sub` we can do this.

```{r, chunk-distances-hclust-euclidean-sub, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

source_url( paste0(path.github,"humanVerseWSU/R/functions-EDA.R") );  # EDA functions ...


hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean$labels = myLabels;
plot.hclust.sub(hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12);

#plot.hclust.sub(hclust.complete.dist.euclidean, k=12);
```

### (10 points) Review one clustering tree (dendrogram)

Choose either `hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean` or `hclust.complete.dist.euclidean` and review how the U.S. state capitals are clustered.  [I commented out one form, so you will have to re-run if you want to select that one.]

Comment on the "face validity" of this approach based on your understanding about how the U.S. regions are defined?  Are the North/South Dakotas together?  What about the North/South Carolinas?  What about the Pacific Northwest?  While living in Kentucky, some people called the area "Kentuckiana" meaning Kentucky/Indiana.  Does that show up?  Also note anything that seems peculiar.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

These clusters show North Dakota and South Dakota clustered together as well as Wyoming and Colorado. Geographically these states clustered are right next to each other with similar weather conditions. Arizona and New Mexico are also cluster together and geographically are neighbors. North and South Carolina are clustered together. Washington is clustered together with Oregon, and California is clustered with Nevada and those two clusters are clustered together. Kentucky and Indiana are clustered together. I found it interesting but not surprising that Hawaii and Alaska is clustered alone. It seems weird that Kansas is clustered with New England.

</pre>


### Additional remarks about `hclust`

I find `hclust` to be a nice initial perusal of the data.  

If you want to understand the stability of a particular `hclust` to use it for something other than an "initial perusal of the data," I would recommend `pvclust` which I introduced in the weekly notebooks.  It is often used in peer-reviewed research, as it provides a `p-value` of sorts regarding the **stability** of the `hclust` structure.

## GENERIC clustering 
Aggregating or agglomerating data is typically called "clustering".  In exploration, we can create some generic clustering techniques.  Below we will create two adhoc clustering rules.

### Arbitrary Aggregation

Recall the "movie dataset" with "Will Smith" and "Denzel Washington".  We have a collection of movies, and how much money each movie made at the box office.  We could organize those movies by some arbitrary rules.  For example:

- Cluster 1:  NA.  We have missing data regarding the money.  So let's put all movies that are NA into that cluster.
- Cluster 2:  Under a million dollars
- Cluster 3:  1-4.99... million dollars (greater than or equal to one, but less than 5)
- Cluster 4:  5-49.99... 
- Cluster 5:  50+

### Aggregating using Quantiles

John Tukey emphasized that ordering the data and then splitting it based on the ordering was a fundamental premise of exploratory data analysis.  

#### Tukey's Summary Data

John Tukey proposed five elements as primary data for analysis.

- the minimum `min`
- the maximum `max`

Sorting the data makes it easiest to find these data, and will be useful to find the other three exploratory summary features.

This is what I would call "slice and dice".  The data is cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting point" is the `Q2` which we call the `median`.

Next, the lower half could also be cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting" point is `Q1`.

Then, the upper half could also be cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting" point is `Q3`.

A common metric derived from this "median-split" procedure is called the interquartile range `IQR` which is defined as the distance between `Q3` and `Q1`.  It literally represents the middle 50% of the data; 50% of the elements of the dataset are between `Q3` and `Q1`.  


<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### Quartile Example 
```{r, chunk-quartiles, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = 1:99;
length(x);

median(x);
x[50];

median(x[1:49]);
x[25];

median(x[51:99]);
x[75];

# probability-approach ... 
# algorithm: the default type=7
stats::quantile(x, prob = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), type=1);

```

Algorithms address various issues associated with dividing numbers and whether or not to include the dividing number in the subset division, but the principle holds.

We can generalize this idea by not always cutting the data in half (median-split as `n=2`, median-median-split as `n=4`).  Instead, we could cut by tens (we call them deciles).  Or we could cut by hundreds (we call them centiles).  The function `quantile` performs this operation, and if you dig into the `doStatsSummary` function used in this course, you can see its application.

#stats::quantile(x, prob=seq(0.1,0.9,by=0.1), type=1 );

# (2) for the rest of the data, break it up into deciles
# (3) $cluster.deciles for a given movie should be NA, 1, 2, 3, ... 10

## CENTROID clustering (k-means) as a function of distance

### Introduction
Rather than clustering on distance-linkage in a pair-wise fashion, we can cluster based on randomly selecting just `k` points in our data and begin identifying their nearest neighbors using some distance approach.

For example, if `k=3`, we would randomly select three of our data points.  We would then compute the distances from all of the remaining points to these `3` anchor points.  The points that are closest to a given anchor will be assigned to that anchor.  At the end of the stage, we now have new data, so a new centroid is determined.  At this point, the centroid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid> is likely not one of our data points, but a location within the given centroid cluster.  In the "naive" approach, you merely take an average (mean) of all the members of your cluster.  More advanced approaches (the default "Hartigan-Wong" of `kmeans`) utilize deviations from the average, called a sum-of-squares approach.  This is why in our `kmeans-notebook` we analyzed the `wss` to ascertain how many clusters `k` should we use.

Regardless, after the new centroids (centers) for the clusters are determined, the process iterates.  All distances are computed from all points to the new centroids; points are assigned to a given centroid cluster (in this example: 1, 2, 3); a new centroid center is computed, and we repeat the process until a stopping rule is reached: maybe we have exhausted the number of iterations allowed (`iter.max` parameter of `kmeans`)?  Or maybe we are not changing membership of any of the data points?  Or maybe we have met some objective (like `wss`)?

It is possible to get a `kmeans` result by merely starting with `3 different` random points.  In general, `kmeans` is fast (and our computers are so much faster than the computers of 1990: the first computer I built in 1995 had 32MB of RAM, a Pentium processor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium#Pentium> and a 900MB Cheetah hard-drive).

Anyway, we can utilize the parameter `nstart` to try many different starting values, and let the program identify the best, most consistent solution.

### My recommendations

I would recommend the default algorithm `Hartigan-Wong` with `iter.max=100` and `nstart=100`.  You can test the timings from the default values: `iter.max=10` and `nstart=1`.  Since the data is likely multidimensional `stars` are the best way to summary the results and membership of `kmeans`.  Please see the "kmeans-notebook" for examples.

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

### WIKIPEDIA CLIMATE DATA

For the 50 U.S. cities, we harvested climate data.  In the "Wikipedia" notebook, details of that data provenance were outlined.  If we want to compare the cities using the climate data, we have to build a matching dataframe, which means we have to select features that exist in each city's climate data set.

There are four temperature features that are always present:

- Record high F (C) ... we will call it "high.max"
- Average high F (C) ... we will call it "high.avg"
- Average low F (C) ... we will call it "low.avg"
- Record low F (C)  ... we will call it "low.max" [probably not the best name choice, but it is parallel in form to the first element]

Additionally, for precipitation we have:

- Average precipitation inches (mm) ... we will call it "rain"
- Average snowfall inches (cm) ... we will call it "snow"

For each of these features we have 12 months of data.  This is a nice dataset.  Let's see what we can do with it.


#### Basic Background Research
We should begin by doing a bit of peripheral research on the topic, to gain "domain knowledge" so we know what to do with the data.  A few elements that would benefit.

I like that you can clearly see highs and lows throughout the year. I dislike the way the snow and rain is displayed and I also wish there was a line throughout the year plotting the average temp. I also think it may be helpful to have a vertical line to tell what month alines with what temp.

The x axis seems to be scaled the same in both plots but the y axis shows scaled different for each plot (unique to data). 

Rain is the circle and snow is the solid. I dont think it was a bad approach but I would have used two different colors and plot them overlaying on a line plot. Similar to the way you did the other plot for temperature.

##### (5 points) One Publication Graph

We are in exploration, so the "one" research graphic may be very different than the "one" formal graphic designed for a client.  Typically, the final graphic needs to meet certain criteria:

- Very pleasing aesthetically 
- Interactive if possible
- Live data feeds if possible
- Served in a secure, safe, private location (if required by the client)

To demonstrate the differences, I created a mockup of our 50 U.S. cities and put it into a nice finalized product form called "highcharts".  

<http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_EXAMPLES_/fiddle_usmap/>

It pulls data in real time (using AJAX) to grab the weather at the latitudes/longitudes we defined in our Wikipedia notebook.  

- You can use your mouse to draw a box to zoom in.  
- The third-wheel on the mouse also helps you zoom in/out.
- Hold down CNTRL with your left hand and use your mouse key to drag the map.  It seems to only "pan" in the x-direction at the moment.  
- The data in the popup displayed can be customized.  I report the temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit and also display the population data we gathered from Wikipedia. 

Once you have a template built, it is rather easy to modify it.  Here I changed the background map, and all of the data/features stay the same:

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">
### Which Features to Include in the Analysis

* months, you can pick all of them `1:12` or maybe just one month per season (April, July, October, January)
* X, depending on what you chose for months, you can now select what climate columns you want to use
  - Some of Temperature Data
  - All of Temperature Data
  - Precipitation Data
  - Everything (All of Temperature Data, Precipitation Data)
  
If we want to cluster cities, which decisions seem best?  Why?  As you can see from the code below, you just comment out two options, and can quickly rerun the analysis.

- WHICH MONTHS
- WHICH COLUMNS

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### WHICH MONTHS & WHICH COLUMNS
```{r, chunk-climate-which-features, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

climate = utils::read.csv( paste0(path.mshaffer, "_data_/state-capitals/final/state-capitals-climatedata.txt"), header=TRUE, quote="", sep="|");

##################### WHICH MONTHS #####################
########################################################
#months = 1:12; # all the data
months = c(1,4,7,10); # one month of each of the four seasons
########################################################


month.abb;  # ?month.abb
month.name;  

month.name[months];  # these are the names of the months you are selecting ...


# this function would allow us to use different months as criteria and different climate-data keys.  It is variadic and flexible.  `key.n` are the names we will use for our new columns ...

climate.df = buildClimateDataFrame(climate, months, keys=c("Record high F (C)", "Average high F (C)", "Average low F (C)", "Record low F (C)", "Average precipitation inches (mm)", "Average snowfall inches (cm)"), keys.n = c("highmax", "highavg",  "lowavg", "lowmin", "rain", "snow") );

climate.df;
names(climate.df); # this helps you see the indexes ...
#View(climate.df)
##################### WHICH COLUMNS #####################
########################################################
#X = climate.df[,5:52];  # temperature
#X = climate.df[,5:76];  # was 76 everything (includes rain)
#X = climate.df[,5:20];  # temperature, 1 month per season
X = climate.df[,5:28];  # everything (includes rain), 1 month per season
########################################################


  rownames(X) = climate.df$labels;
Xs = scale(X);
```

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">

### To scale or not to scale, that is the question

```{r, chunk-distances-X-or-Xs, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

X = climate.df[,5:28];  # everything ... you have to change months above to get this dataframe to be the correct size ... months = 1:12
  rownames(X) = climate.df$labels;
Xs = scale(X);

```


So let's do some analysis with all of the data available to us.  Most of the data is in Temperature, with ranges from -42 degrees Fahrenheit (Helena, Montana) to 122 (Phoenix, Arizona).

The precipitation data (rain and snow) is measured in inches.  So should we scale the data.  The answer in PCA and orthogonal projections is absolutely YES, but for `hclust` and `kmeans` is that always the case?

You can make a choice below, and observe how it influences your answers. 

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### WHICH X
```{r, chunk-distances-whichX, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

whichX = X;
#whichX = Xs;

```

<HR divider="5" style="border: 5px solid #981e32; border-radius: 5px;">
### Perform `k-means` on All Climate Features

With the selected features let's perform k-means.  Let's select k=12.  I will select all of the features, but you can change that if you wish.

#### Descriptives of Sample
```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-setup-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}



colors = rainbow(50, s = 0.6, v = 0.75); # 50 colors for 50 states

# descriptive star plot to start
stars(whichX, len = 0.5, key.loc=c(12,2), draw.segments = TRUE);

## too busy, let's group them
x.start = 1;
x.end = 10;
for(i in 1:5)
  {
  stars( whichX[x.start:x.end,] , 
          len = 0.5, key.loc=c(6,2), draw.segments = TRUE);
  x.start = 1 + x.end;
  x.end = 10 + x.end;
  }

```

Above, you are just analyzing the general shapes.  Which ones are "fuller" circles?  Why?  

Circles representing Arizona and Hawaii are both "fuller" because they're representing hotter temperatures throughout the year. The bigger the slice the higher the correlation for that month.

Which ones are not very "full circles"?  Why?

Circles representing Montana and Maine show not very "full circles" because they're implying throughout the year the temperatures not extremely hot (probably cold), and shows rain/snow there spiking in the later months Oct-Dec. Another conclusion I would draw from this is ones with less full circles that dont have spikes in temperature, they have more consistent cold weather.

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

#### Computation of Clusters/Centroids


```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-run-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

k = 12;
iterations = 100;
number.starts = 100;

whichX.kmeans = kmeans(whichX, 12, 
                    iter.max=iterations, 
                    nstart = number.starts);  # default algorithm
stars(whichX.kmeans$centers, len = 0.5, key.loc = c(10, 3),
        main = "Algorithm: DEFAULT [Hartigan-Wong] \n Stars of KMEANS=12", draw.segments = TRUE);

```

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

#### Cluster Membership and Centroid Attributes


```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-table-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}



membership = matrix( whichX.kmeans$cluster, ncol=1);
membership = membership[order(membership),];
membership = as.data.frame(membership);
        rownames(membership) = climate.df$labels;
        colnames(membership) = c("Cluster");

membership;

print( table(membership) ) ; 

# I believe in an older version of R these were called $centroids
attributes = as.data.frame( whichX.kmeans$centers );
    rownames(attributes) = paste0("Cluster.",1:12);
  attributes;
    
```

#### (10 points) Summarize Findings

- Identify which states share a common cluster. 
- For a given cluster, what are its primary characteristics 

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

There are many stats that share common clusters as we are looking at 12 clusters. Looking at the first cluster it contains Montgomery AL, Juneau Ak, and Phoenix AZ. I am not sure why Ak is in this cluster because Al and Az both have higher temperature and less rain then Ak. Therefore, I think Ak should be clustered with weather that has less warm weather. For each given cluster I would assume each would be clustered with states that have similar weather. 

</pre>

[
Summarize your k-means findings for 12 clusters.

## (15 points) Correlation

Correlation, like distance, is an important feature of multivariate analysis.  So let's review some basic correlation related to our climate data.  For simplicity, let's consider "Record High Temperature" and "Record Low Temperature" and see how they correlate with other factors we have gathered from Wikipedia.

Recall, in this table, "Jan-Dec" are different months of the same temperature variable.  

```{r, chunk-correlations-high, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(Hmisc); # p-values for correlation

high = subsetDataFrame(climate, c("key", "units"), "==", c("Record high F (C)",1));
high = merge(high, capitals, by=c("capital","state"));

high.X = high[,c(5:18,21)]; # numeric data
high.cor = round( cor(high.X), digits=2);
# high.cor.p = rcorr(as.matrix(high.X), type="pearson");  # p-values for statistical significance ... # str(high.cor.p);

# examine July (idx = 7)

as.data.frame( high.cor ) ; # so it will render nicely in RStudio

high.cor.july = high.cor[,7];
high.cor.july;
#View(high.cor.july)

```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

I think June, July, and August correlate the most with latitude because they have the strongest correlation (even though it is negative). I think the winter months Nov, Dec, Jan have the least correlation as they have strong negative correlation. No I dont think the correlation for this data would change unless there was a huge shift change in weather.

</pre>

Describe the correlation of July in "Record high F (C)" to the other numeric factors printed above. 

**x is correlated with y (0.00).  This correlation is positive/negative which means ...  This correlation is strong/weak because ... overall, this suggests ... **

- July perfectly correlates with July (1.00).  This correlation is positive and very strong.  This is because they are the same data.
- With the months, you can note each, or plot a trend showing them, and discussing them briefly as a trend.
- latitude is a measure of north/south, so be certain to apply the correlation value with some meaning.  be certain you know which direction is positive or negative to correctly interpret the sign of the correlation.
- longitude is a measure of east/west, so be certain ...
- population is the size of the city  

- intuitively, which months do you think correlate most with latitude for this data?  which correlate the least?  is the correlation always the same sign (positive/negative), or does it change? 



[You can use the dataframe output to do this analysis, or create your own subset]

```{r, chunk-correlations-low, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(Hmisc); # p-values for correlation

low = subsetDataFrame(climate, c("key", "units"), "==", c("Record low F (C)",1));
low = merge(low, capitals, by=c("capital","state"));

low.X = low[,c(5:18,21)]; # numeric data
low.cor = round( cor(low.X), digits=2);
# low.cor.p = rcorr(as.matrix(low.X), type="pearson");  # p-values for statistical significance ... # str(low.cor.p);

# examine Jan (idx = 1)

as.data.frame( low.cor ) ; # so it will render nicely in RStudio

low.cor.january = low.cor[,1];
low.cor.january;

```

Describe the correlation of January in "Record low F (C)" to the other numeric factors printed above. 


<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

I think Dec, Feb, and Mar correlate the most with latitude data because they have the strongest correlation. I think Jun, Jul, and Aug have the weakest correlation. No I dont think the correlation for this data would change unless there was a huge shift change in weather.

</pre>

Similar to "high" writeup, but for the "low" data.

## "So What" is DATA ANALYSIS?

In the social sciences (e.g., Karl Weick), the concept of "sense making" refers to "the process by which people give meaning to their collective experiences".  I have used this framework in my high-technology innovation research (See Figure 1 of <http://www.mshaffer.com/arizona/pdf/LoneGenius.pdf>, my rubric concept comes from learning-theory growth models:  Nascent, Adolescent, Mature.) 

This final topic is reflective:  we are thinking about how we think.

### Statistics

The syllabus defined statistics as "the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data." (See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics>)

There are 5 elements mentioned:  collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of "data".  Are those equally weighted?  That is, should we devote 20% of our time to each of those?  Now, consider the "analysis" stage.  I have suggested there are two camps:  exploratory and confirmatory data analysis.  Are those equally weighted?  That is, should we devote 50% of our time to each of those?  Now, in an "equally-likely" scenario, we would have.

```{r, chunk-conclusion-equally-likely, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = c(20,20,15,10,15,20);
x.labels = c("collection", "organization", "EDA analysis", "CDA analysis", "interpretation", "presentation");
x.colors = c("blue", "lightgreen", "green", "darkgreen", "orange", "red");

barplot(x, 
        col = x.colors,
        ylim = c(0, 20),
        ylab = "Proportion: (Sums to 100)",
        main="Statistics as the Study of 'Data'");


text(1.14* (1:6), par("usr")[3], col = x.colors, labels = x.labels, srt = 45, adj = c(1.1,1.1), xpd = TRUE, cex=.75);
```

### Data Analytics

<IMG src="http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_images_/data-analytics.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" />
<div>**Source: https://data-analytics.wsu.edu/197-2/ ** (Accessed October 2010) </div>

"Data analytics is the application of powerful new methods—drawn from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and domain sciences—to collect, curate, analyze, discover and communicate knowledge from 'big data'." <https://data-analytics.wsu.edu/> (Accessed October 2010)


#### Importance of 'Data'

I love data.  

I also love math/physics.  I also love exploratory data analysis.  I also love computational statistics or statistical computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics>.  I also love thinking about developing the one graphic to summarize data most effectively.

#### Apprenticeship as Learning a Trade
The idea of sharing in the learning process is an important aspect of the apprenticeship model.  You are learning a trade (data analytics).  I have experience in this trade.  My job as the instructor is to provide you with a variety of "situated-learning" experiences To help you understand the nature of the trade.   This exam is an example of such an experience.

#### Tools of the Trade

Below are the core requirements for the data analytics program:

* Calculus and linear algebra (10 credits)
* Computer science fundamentals (11 credits)
* Machine learning and data management (9 credits)
* Statistics (15 credits)
* Data analytics introduction, ethics & project-focused * capstone experience (9 credits)

These are not the tools of the trade, but hopefully, they introduce you to key tools of the trade.  What exactly are tools of the trade? [You will have an opportunity to write a response below.]

#### Dimensional Reduction, an Axiomatic View

This video was recently shared with me that highlights some distinctions among persons practicing various forms of data analysis <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGlCi9jOWY>.  As an orthogonal projection, I would create two axes.  On the horizontal axis (x-axis), I would place "theory of data" to the left and "application of data" toward the right.  On the vertical axis (y-axis), I would place "care for data integrity" at the top and "less care for data integrity" at the bottom.

#### Skills of the Trade

As someone that is coming from industry, having hired young people like you out of Computer Science, Electrical-Computer Engineering, I have opinions related to skills of the trade.

* Can you acquire an appreciation for "data intimacy"?
* Can you track and document how data is curated?
* Can you track and document the analyses you perform?  Can you recreate them?  Do you have basic version-control protocols in place?
* Can you view data from multiple perspectives and synthesize those perspectives to identify the central them of the data?  Can you be objective?  Can you try and identify objective metrics to enlighten your understanding about the essence of data?
* Can you experiment with different visualizations in search of an optimal "one graphic" result?  Do you have practice using various visualization tools?  Can you comprehend which visualization tool is appropriate for messaging (communicating results) to a particular audience?
* Can you communicate and defend your findings to a particular audience?  Are your communications professional?  Is the final work product both simple and comprehensive:  simple in its summary findings and comprehensive in its ability to be replicated and audited as necessary.

## (20 points) YOUR OPINION OF DATA ANALYTICS 

[This is worth 20 points.

Specifically, address: 

(1) what proportion of "statistics" should be divided among: collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of "data" ... providing a `barplot` of your opinion within your response would seem appropriate


```{r, chunk-conclusion-student-perspective, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = c(20,20,15,10,15,20);  ## change these values and discuss ...
x.labels = c("collection", "organization", "EDA analysis", "CDA analysis", "interpretation", "presentation");
x.colors = c("blue", "lightgreen", "green", "darkgreen", "orange", "red");

barplot(x, 
        col = x.colors,
        ylim = c(0, max(x)),
        ylab = "Proportion: (Sums to 100)",
        main="Statistics as the Study of 'Data'");


text(1.14* (1:6), par("usr")[3], col = x.colors, labels = x.labels, srt = 45, adj = c(1.1,1.1), xpd = TRUE, cex=.75);
```

(2) what tools of the trade should you be acquiring from the core courses?  how are you doing in that acquisition process (e.g., tool X is ... and right now I feel like my understanding/proficiency of tool X ... ) ... 

(3) utilize the provided `plot` script to place the coure-course categories on the proposed x-y graph related to analytics practice (Applied vs Theoretical) and care of data integrity (Great Care vs Little Care) ... Also place your personal assessment on the plot script provided

(4) evaluate your skill-level on the six "skills of the trade":  Emerging (Nascent), Developing (Adolescent), Mastering (Mature).  explain your evaluation and include other important skills you believe are relevant that are not included

(5) Any other comments you would like to share.

]

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

(1) I think the appropriate proportion of statistic would be (20,20,15,10,15,20). The reason for giving higher ratings for collection and organization is because in my own experience (even this semester) when you collect data poorly or record it incorrectly, it can cause a lot of difficulty. Therefore, I think good collection and organization are very important. Presentation is also more important because if your boss cannot read your presentation or get use out if it, it is useless.

(2) I think some tools we should be taking away from this class is plots/ggplot, distance methods (meeus, haversine, manhattan), clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and k means. I feel confident with most of the content but very good about the hierarchical clustering and plot/ggplot the most.

(3) You can see I put myself at a high care for data integrity, and more towards applied data practice rather than theoretical data practice.

(4) I think that I fall between Developing and Mastering. I say that because somethings like tracking, documenting, and recreating analysis I have mastered but some things I dont not feel as confident with. For example, I know plot and ggplot (I am not expert) but don't feel too confident about creating a good "one graphic" result.

(5) FEEDBACK: I like the idea of weekly videos. I personally feel I stay more on top of things. I think that when you post a video or make any changes to documents that you want us to know, you should just make an announcement. I actually get those notification like a text message, so I think it would be beneficial. Lastly, I think the exam could have been a little shorter but I understand there was a lot you wanted to cover.
